abstract = {By moving network appliance functionality from proprietary hardware to software, Network Function Virtualization promises to bring the advantages of cloud computing to network packet processing. However, the evolution of cloud computing (particularly for data analytics) has greatly benefited from application-independent methods for scaling and placement that achieve high efficiency while relieving programmers of these burdens. NFV has no such general management solutions. In this paper, we present a scalable and application-agnostic scheduling framework for packet processing, and compare its performance to current approaches.},

title = {A quantum network stack and protocols for reliable entanglement-based networks},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We present a stack model for breaking down the complexity of entanglement-based quantum networks. More specifically, we focus on the structures and architectures of quantum networks and not on concrete physical implementations of network elements. We construct the quantum network stack in a hierarchical manner comprising several layers, similar to the classical network stack, and identify quantum networking devices operating on each of these layers. The layers responsibilities range from establishing point-to-point connectivity, over intra-network graph state generation, to inter-network routing of entanglement. In addition we propose several protocols operating on these layers. In particular, we extend the existing intra-network protocols for generating arbitrary graph states to ensure reliability inside a quantum network, where here reliability refers to the capability to compensate for devices failures. Furthermore, we propose a routing protocol for quantum routers which enables the generation of arbitrary graph states across network boundaries. This protocol, in correspondence with classical routing protocols, can compensate dynamically for failures of routers, or even complete networks, by simply re-routing the given entanglement over alternative paths. We also consider how to connect quantum routers in a hierarchical manner to reduce complexity, as well as reliability issues arising in connecting these quantum networking devices.}

abstract = {Abstract With the advent of cloud computing, many new networking concepts have been introduced to simplify network management and bring innovation through network programmability. The emergence of the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm is one of these adopted concepts in the cloud model so as to eliminate the network infrastructure maintenance processes and guarantee easy management. In this fashion, SDN offers real-time performance and responds to high availability requirements. However, this new emerging paradigm has been facing many technological hurdles; some of them are inherent, while others are inherited from existing adopted technologies. In this paper, our purpose is to shed light on SDN related issues and give insight into the challenges facing the future of this revolutionary network model, from both protocol and architecture perspectives. Additionally, we aim to present different existing solutions and mitigation techniques that address SDN scalability, elasticity, dependability, reliability, high availability, resiliency, security, and performance concerns.
